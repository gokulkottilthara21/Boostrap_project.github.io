                    Front-end development involves creating a user interface that users can see and interact with directly on a website or Web Application.

                <p class="firstparaone">
                    The biggest challenge associated with front-end development is the constant change in tools and techniques for developing a website’s front end, which requires the developer to constantly keep up with how the field is evolving.

                <p class="firstparaone">
                    However, before we go into these front-end technologies, let us first grasp the meaning of front-end development.

          <p class="card-text">The visual appeal of every existing website or application you’ve seen has been brought to life by Front-End developers. The front-end layer enables you to interact with the web and perform desired actions, such as watching videos and shopping online, etc. To create the design, feel, and look of the web, three fundamental front-end programming languages are used: HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript
            Front-end development (Client-side development) is the process of using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a graphical user interface for a website or web application so that users can interact with them. By using graphical methods, the complex backend portion is represented in an understandable way for the end-user. In the event that your application’s frontend works seamlessly, users are likely to love it and recommend it to others.

It is best known for transforming the web thanks to its dynamic competencies. It has been interactive in nature offering different capabilities like clicking, scrolling, pop-ups, ads, asynchronous calls, etc. It is at the base of many frontend frameworks, at the client-side offering life to webpages.
                    </p>
                    <p class="headingscontent">There are millions of libraries that are leveraged by developer’s world over. There is a separate JavaScript engine that can fasten computations, offering a quicker page loading time. It is a text-based language that is used on the server-side and the client-side, to make interactive web pages, ending the dominance of static pages. As such, it is known for web pages, but there are many non-browser frameworks that use it, for e.g., Node.js, Apache CouchDB, etc.<br>
